# codegen-llm

This project focuses on fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for code generation. It leverages state-of-the-art models and techniques to generate code based on natural language prompts.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the project.
    - `data_prep.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
    - `train.py`: Script for training the model.
    - `utils.py`: Utility functions.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
